# Academic Asylum
## About
Academic Asylum is a 2D platformer designed for a year 10 IST assessment. The game is meant to be a play on the social issue of academic stress, with the game being about a student who has to pass through multiple classrooms while at the mercy of his teacher throwing books at him, with the teacher increasing in speed and range through every classroom the student manages to get through.
