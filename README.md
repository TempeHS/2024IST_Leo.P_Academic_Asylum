# Developer Documentation
## What I intended to make
I intended to create a 2D platformer relating to the social issue of academic stress, an issue experienced by most young people in modern society. The game will be called Academic Asylum and will be based in an Australian high school, where players pick a character to play as in the game, and advance through different levels, or school grades, until they beat the game and graduate. 

The game is aimed to appeal towards high school students, as high school students are the playable characters in the game, which would make it easier for the players to connect with the character. Another reason as to why the game is targeted towards high school students is due to the game being based around the social issue of academic stress, an issue most high school students will admit to experiencing. The game would teach students how to deal with academic stress, making the game educational and fun, so people can both learn something from it and have a fun time doing so. 

The game will be able to change studentâ€™s actions towards experiencing academic stress due to the game showcasing tactics on how to deal with stress, such as the possibility of implementing in game activities where people learn about time management, breathing techniques to reduce stress, study techniques and more.
## Evaluation of success
My game was able to fufill the main parts of what I intended to make. However, I was unable to add most of the features I had listed in the last section of what I intended to create. Althought I didn't complete them, my end product turned out well and met the goals I laid out at the begining of my intentions.
